In this article, we report the results of a natural field experiment conducted during an innovation contest held at the cardiology unity of the MGH. Different incentives for participation were announced by manipulating the personal messaging to employees. Messaging emphasized either available prizes (iPad mini's) for top submissions, motives for improving patient care and improving the workplace, or a funding opportunity alone. Our data show that announcing a (small) prize for top submissions boosted employee participation by 85 percent, without affecting the quality of the submissions. The effect was the same for men and women, workers with high and low income levels, and appears too large to fit a pure contest environment without public good incentives. Our interpretation is that participation was driven by a complementarity between prizes and prosocial preferences towards improving the organization. Using a simple model, we estimate that these preferences can explain about 25 percent of the magnitude of the effect.

One objection to this interpretation is that employees could have had other motivations to take part in the innovation contest. Common factors are the prospect of promotion and career advancement [@baker1994internal; @gibbs1995incentive] or prestige and peer recognition [@kosfeld2011getting; @blanes2011tournaments]. While these other factors are important and could have influenced overall participation levels, these can not explain the significant differences in participation between the treatments. Even assuming that winning the contest was a high chance for a promotion, we designed the experiment so that our interventions were minimal and would not affect the ex-ante probability of being promoted in each condition. Likewise, after the competition, peer recognition was the same in all treatments as publicity was the same regardless of the winner's treatment (the HTL announced the winners online and awarded the prizes during a public event at MGH). Hence, even if employees had a baseline utility from winning (other than prize money), this value was not different across treatments and, therefore, can not explain significant differences between treatments.


Another concern is with _contamination_ or _interference_ between experimental units [@rosenbaum2007interference]. This situation is problematic as it violates the SUTVA for causal inference [@rubin1974estimating]. With contamination, for instance, decisions of one staff member depend on its treatment and on the treatments of others, such as its neighbors. This may lead to a bias that depends on the level of interference (how intense is the communication among subjects) but also on the association between individual and neighborhood treatments (how dense is the network of social interactions). However, one should not be too much worried about contamination in our setting. First, the resulting bias would be toward a null effect and, therefore, would have worked against our finding significant differences between treatments. In intuitive terms, if everyone had the same information about the contest, participation would have been the same in each condition.  Second, internal communication during the submission phase was likely small: staff members competing against one another had only weak incentives for information sharing. In addition, one may expect participation rates to converge over time, as staff members share information. Contrary to this expectation, we find little evidence of converge when we examine the dynamic of submission. Another reason to not be too concerned with contamination is that the bias disappears with a growing sample size and with a sparse network [@forastiere2016identification]. In our setting, the sample size was large being of over 1200 units; and the network of interactions was sparse given the limited number of participants and the diversity of tasks and roles inside the organization (doctors, nurses, administrative workers, technicians, researchers, etc.). Hence, and overall, even if there was a bias due to contamination, one should expect such bias to be small.


One might also worry that employees had a poor understanding of the costs from winning the contest which may explain the participation effects. An empirical regularity in laboratory experiments on contests [see @dechenaux2014survey] is that people are likely to make mistakes, which may lead to higher effort levels than predicted. Here, a serious concern is that employees in the PRIZE treatment underestimated the costs of taking part in the implementation phase. Announcing prizes may have made more salient the immediate rewards (the iPad's) inducing employees to pay less attention to the costs of being involved in implementing their own project. If so, some of those who submitted proposals in the PRIZE treatment would reconsider their choice as the competition moved to the implementation phase. Instead, we find that only a negligible fraction of employees submitting proposals were not responsive to the invitation or declined participation in the implementation phase; a behavior that was not different across treatments. Hence, although employees might have had incorrect beliefs or systematic biases that lowered expected costs from winning, these are unlikely to explain the observed significant differences.

Another finding that deserves further comment is that responses were sensitive to the gender of the solicited person. Indeed, women's participation was greater than men's when emphasizing the patient care mission, controlling for the profession. This result echoes  @delfgaauw2013tournament showing gender differences in a sales contest associated with the way a competition is announced or "framed." This finding is open to various interpretations. One possibility is that female workers may be more altruistic or perceive the mission of the organization differently than male workers. However, the existing literature in economics [@croson2009gender] is not unanimous on this point. Another possibility is that workers were affected in their submission decisions by self-stereotypes associated with the framing condition. Gender-based stereotypes are indeed pervasive in healthcare organizations [@evans2002cautious]. So one may speculate that men's propensity to participate was lower in activities perceived as female-typed. In this sense, our study is related to @coffman2014evidence who finds evidence in the laboratory that women are less likely to contribute ideas to groups when the topic falls in male-typed domains, e.g., sports, and vice versa. 

An interesting (non-)finding is the lack of gender-based differences with respect to participation in the prize (PRIZE) treatment where women’s participation was equal to men’s. An extensive literature in economics has shown significant gender differences in preferences women concerning risk-aversion [@borghans2009gender] and women's distaste for competition compared to men [@niederle2007women]. So, one may be concerned that using a contest incentive structure to encourage the private provision of a public good would discourage participation by women. In our experiment, by contrast, women participated most in the treatment emphasizing the contest prize suggesting that this type of contest is robust to these effects. This result could be driven by some unique characteristics of our subject pool (healthcare professional workers), the exploration of which is beyond the scope of the present study.

However, it is also possible that the commitment provided workers with a reference point on which they formed their beliefs resulting in an increased incentive to free-ride.  No quality difference

Finally, one key concern when combining a pecuniary incentive with contributions to a public good is the interaction of incentives with the motive to contribute. A *negative interaction* occurs when incentives crowd-out the motive to contribute. Crowding out effects have been seen in other experiments in the context of blood donations [@lacetera2013economic; @lacetera2014rewarding], or the crowding in effects seen with public "bads" in daycare pick-ups [@gneezy2000fine]. We do not observe evidence of a crowding-out in our environment, but differences in context make comparisons difficult. Pecuniary incentives may not have the same effect if in-kind gifts are used in place of currency [e.g., @kube2012currency], or if the setting already involves an employer-employee relationship [e.g., @fehr1998gift].

In conclusion, the results presented here have implications that go beyond the specific organization under study. Using a competition for prizes appears a profitable way for firms to encourage contributions among workers in situations resembling a private provision of public goods. In many settings, this approach can be more effective than what is acknowledged in the traditional tournament theory literature. The reason being that the incentive effect of prizes interacts with prosocial motivations of workers to exert effort. The management can appeal to internal motivations towards the mission of the organization to raise the level of voluntary contributions. However, this may be tricky in practice due to the heterogeneity of motivated agents. In particular, the evidence on gender differences in response to framing suggests female workers may perceive the goals of the organization differently from male workers. Investigating the causes of these gender-based differences is left as an avenue for future research.

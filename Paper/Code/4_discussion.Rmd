===========

We report results of a natural field experiment conducted at a medical organization that held an innovation contest seeking contribution of public goods (i.e., projects for organizational improvement) from its more than 1200 employees. The experiment tested incentives for contributing by manipulating the content of emails soliciting staff participation.  We presented different incentives to participate in the contest, such as a prize (iPad mini) for winning submissions, improving patient care, improving the workplace, and funding for implementation. Each staff was randomly assigned to receiving an email containing one of the four incentives. Our data show that offering a prize for winning submissions boosted participation by 85 percent without affecting the quality of the submissions. The effect was consistent across gender and job type. We posit that the allure of a prize, in combination with mission-oriented preferences, drove participation. Using a simple model, we estimate that these preferences explain about a third of the magnitude of the effect. 

These results were sensitive to the solicited person's gender. Women's participation was greater than men's when email solicitations emphasized patient care, controlling for profession. One possible explanation for this finding is that female staff may be more altruistic and more responsive to the issue of improving patient care than male staff. However, the existing economic literature on gender differences in altruistic preferences [see @croson2009gender] does not fully support this explanation. Another possible reason for women's greater responsiveness to patient care involves gender-based stereotypes, which are pervasive in health care organizations [@evans2002cautious]. Male staff could have judged the contribution of an innovation project towards patient care improvement as a female-typed activity. Similarly, @coffman2014evidence report that, in laboratory experiments, women were less likely to contribute ideas to groups when the topic falls in male-typed domains, e.g., sports, and vice versa.

An interesting non-finding is the lack of gender-based differences in the PRIZE treatment; we found that women's participation was equal to men's. An extensive literature in economics has revealed women's tendency to be risk-averse [@borghans2009gender] and a distaste for competition [@niederle2007women], suggesting that a contest for prize may discourage women's participation. In our experiment, however, women participated the most in the PRIZE treatment. We suspect that the unique characteristics of our subject pool (e.g., careers in health care) could have led to this finding.

While not observed, there could have been negative interactions between the prize incentive and the contest that encouraged staff members to contribute to public good by suggesting an organizational improvement opportunity. A negative interaction occurs when a particular incentive might crowds out the motive to contribute; for example, providing a self-serving incentive might negatively interact with a self-sacrificing activity and crowd out the motivation to participate in this activity. Experiments in the context of blood donations [@lacetera2013economic; @lacetera2014rewarding], or public "bads" in daycare pick-ups [@gneezy2000fine] indicate crowd-out effects. Pecuniary incentives may not have the same effect if in-kind gifts are used in place of currency [e.g., @kube2012currency], or if the setting already involves an employer-employee  relationship [e.g, @fehr1998gift]. 


Ulterior motivations such as the prospect of a promotion [@baker1994internal; @gibbs1995incentive], professional prestige, or peer recognition [@kosfeld2011getting; @blanes2011tournaments] could have propelled participation. However, the likelihood of career advancement through participating in the contest seems marginal as promotions in academic hospitals are typically based on the number of publications, tenure, and professional training. In addition, our email solicitations contained incentives that are fairly neutral to potential career advancement opportunities associated with the contest. Recognition for authors of winning proposals included announcement during a hospital-wide public event and listing on the hospital website. These opportunities to be acknowledged equally affected all potential participants. 

The Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) for causal inference [@rubin1974estimating] is relevant for all randomized experiments. In our study, it is possible that communication among staff assigned to different treatment arms could have influenced decisions to participate. The magnitude of the resulting effects would depend on the level of interference (i.e., intensity of staff communication)  and the density of staff' network of social interactions. Although this bias could severely distort our estimates, we expect the bias to cause differences in participation across treatments to converge to zero (a bias towards null effect) as communication spreads the content of the different email solicitations. Our findings exhibit little evidence of convergence. Communication among staff during the contest was likely limited as the Heart Center staff are scattered across multiple buildings on the hospital campus and competition provides weak incentives for information sharing. 

Staffs' poor understanding of the costs arising from winning the contest could explain their participation. In the same vein, a large experimental literature on contests [@dechenaux2014survey]  shows that similar misconception could lead to higher effort levels than predicted. In particular, those in the PRIZE treatment could have underestimated the costs of participating as the iPad mini accentuated the appeal of an immediate reward and diminish the costs of winning the contest and becoming involved in implementation. Across treatments, however, we find that most of the staff submitted a detailed proposal on their project when invited to do so. Although participants might have had incorrect beliefs about expected costs from winning, these are unlikely to explain the significant differences. 

Finally, while the choice of focusing on healthcare workers may limit the generalizability of our results in some respect, it should be noted that in the US alone health care spending accounts for 17 percent of the GDP (in 2015) and, more generally, our study results are also directly applicable to a variety of other professions exposed to a public good dilemma (e.g., teachers, public servants, researchers). 

Conclusions
-----------

Our results have implications that extend beyond the specific organization under study. Using a contest for prizes appears to be a more profitable way for firms to encourage contribution toward a public good among workers than currently acknowledged in the traditional tournament theory literature. The incentive effect of offering a prize for winning the contest interacts with prosocial motivations fo workers to contribute to the public good.

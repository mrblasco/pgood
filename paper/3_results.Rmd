# Results

## Submissions

We start by examining treatment differences in participation by looking at the percentage of employees who made at least one project submission during the four-week submission phase of the contest.

Table \ref{submit} shows the participation rates by solicitation treatment. For testing the independence between the participation and our solicitations, a Fisher's exact test gives a p-value of 0.026; indicating thus that the observed participation differences can be ascribed to our experimental intervention.

\input{../tables/submit.tex}

Pairwise comparisons among solicitation treatments show further that: (1) the PRIZE solicitation treatment generates xxx, xxx, and xxx times higher participation rates than the WPLACE, PCARE, and FUND, respectively; (2) the PCARE and WPLACE solicitation treatments generate basically identical participation rates; and (3) the FUND solicitation treatment generates xx and xx times less participation rates than xx and xxx. 

\input{../tables/pairwise.tex}

To test to see whether these pairwise differences are statistically significant, we use pairwise two-sample tests of proportions (Table \ref{pairwise}). The analysis reveals that: the positive difference in participation rates between the PRIZE and FUND solicitation treatments is statistically significant (p=0.003); the positive difference between the PRIZE and PCARE  solicitation treatments is marginally significant (p=0.132); whereas the positive difference between the PRIZE and WPLACE solicitation treatments is insignificant (p=0.269); the negative difference between the FUND and WPLACE solicitation treatments is significant (p=0.055); and the negative difference between the FUND and the PCARE solicitation treatments is marginally significant (p=0.124). Overall, these findings are consistent with employee participation being higher under a solicitation with personal awards incentives; and lower under a solicitation with funding incentives.

Next, we turn to examining participation dynamics (Figure \ref{dynamics}). Though our data may not allow for a complete analysis of participation dynamics, looking at the overall submission patterns can be useful for the following reason. If employees assigned to different solicitation treatments were sharing (either face-to-face or electronically) the content of their solicitation with others, one should expect participation rates to converge over time, yielding estimates of the causal effects of a solicitation treatment biased towards zero. Contrary to these expectations, we find no evidence of convergence. Submissions in the PRIZE solicitation treatment are constantly higher than in the other treatments (except perhaps in the final week); at the same time, submissions in the FUND treatment are constantly low. These patterns are hence consistent with communication effects having little, or no, consequences on our findings, a topic we will discuss in greater detail later (Section \ref{discussion}).

Following xxx literature (xxxx), we check whether gender was a factor driving participation in the contest (with men relatively more willing to sort into the competition). But we find no evidence (xxx gives a p-value).  Similarly we check whether the presence of effects associated with unobservable characteristics that vary by job, like differences in income and education.  But we find again no evidence in favor of this hypothesis (xxxx). We find instead evidence that having an office location is xxx associated with participation. This result, however, is confounded by other factors because more senior staff tend to have a fixed location but, at the same time, having a fixed office location is highly correlated with the type of profession (e.g., nurses xxxx).

To complement the above analysis, we use a multiple linear regression model that explicitly controls for observable  differences across staff members. The probability of submitting, $y_i=1$, is given by:

$$\Pr(y_i=1) = \alpha_0 
									+ \sum_{j} \alpha_{j} \text{SOLICIT}_{ij}
									+ \text{JOB}_{i} 
									+ \text{MALE}_{i} 
									+ \text{OFFICE}_{i},\label{submit}$$

where $\alpha_0$ is a constant, $\alpha_j$ is the causal effect of the solicitation treatment $j$ assigned to an employee $i$ ($\text{SOLICIT}_{ij}$), controlling for the employee's profession ($\text{JOB}_i$), the gender ($\text{MALE}_i$), and a dummy for office location ($\text{OFFICE}_i$) indicating whether the employee had a permanent office instead of being assigned to a ward. Notice that, in our context, having a fixed office location is highly correlated with the type of profession.[^Much of the clinical staff might be mobile and only half of the employees ($53$ percent) had fixed office locations, as they may be on duty in multiple wards. More senior staff tend to have a fixed location. So, within each profession, this measure can be viewed as a proxy for status inside the organization.] Nurses, for instance, are more likely to being assigned to a ward than physicians or administrative workers, due to the nature of their job. Within each profession, however, having a fixed office location is usually correlated with the hierarchical position inside the organization. Beyond having a fixed office location per se, this variable is hence potentially controlling for income and hierarchical differences occurring within each profession as well.

\input{../tables/participation_ols.tex}

The regression results (Table \ref{participation ols}) show an insignificant effect on participation associated with an employee's profession or gender.^[The coefficient for nurses is positive and negative for physicians, consistent with sorting. These effects are, however, not statistically different from the residual category of other workers, as well as from one another.] By contrast, we find a positive effect associated with the worker having a fixed office location, as opposed to being assigned to a ward (and the effect size doubles after controlling for the profession and gender). This evidence suggests that differences in the employee's hierarchical position inside the organization, as captured by our office-location regressor, may be a stronger driver of participation relative to differences in gender and profession as sometimes assumed by the literature.

The results of the regression model above (Table \ref{participation ols}) give estimates of the solicitation treatment differences relative to the overall mean participation and controlling for baseline characteristics. In theory, these estimates should be more statistically efficient relative to the pairwise comparisons above (i.e., by reducing the overall noise associated with baseline characteristics). We find that, at the 95 level of statistical significance, employees in the PRIZE solicitation treatment are ` cf.full["treatment2PRIZE"]` percentage points _more_ likely to submit compared to the overall mean, whereas employees in the FUND solicitation treatment are ` -cf.full["treatment2FUND"]` percentage points _less_ likely to do so.^[Subtracting these two effects gives ` cf.full["treatment2PRIZE"] - cf.full["treatment2FUND"]` which is the difference in the probability of submitting between PRIZE and FUND treatments.] Overall, these effects are sizable not only in absolute levels but also relative to the effects of the heterogeneity captured by the other variables.

We now turn to examining treatment interactions involving the employee's gender and profession (Figure \ref{interactions}).^[We find no significant differences for interactions with office location, which we do not report for space limitation.] We hypothesize gender interactions to occur as a result of three main factors: differences in risk taking, social preferences (willingness to contribute to public goods), and competitive inclinations. If women prefer to work on activities that are less risky, more pro-social (e.g., aiming at improving people's health) and where competition is less intense, then we should observe significant treatment interactions.  Similarly, we expect treatment interactions associated with the employee's profession to occur because, for example, the prize opportunity (i.e., the PRIZE treatment) could be relatively less effective for employees with a higher income, such as doctors, than the others.

Introduction
================

Inside organizations, employees often make choices between working on their regular assignment and developing opportunities to improve the workplace. For example, a worker may concentrate on production tasks alone -- with pay and promotion tied to performance in these activities -- or also devote time and energy to solve common organizational problems  -- with no direct compensation for the worker. This situation leads to two key issues in the analysis of incentives inside organizations. First, there is a problem of designing compensation schemes for employees to take the correct actions by addressing any potential  _multitasking_ issue [@holmstrom1991multitask; @hellmann2011incentives; @manso2011motivating]. <!-- Because such opportunities are privately observed, standard incentives may backfire resulting in an inefficient allocation of effort.  --> Second, there is a _public good contribution_ problem. Because of the non-rival nature of work that benefits the organization as a whole, employees may be tempted to avoid working on these tasks in the hope to free-ride on the efforts of others.

An internal competition for prizes, such as a promotion or a bonus, is often viewed as a proper way to provide incentives in such situations. Contests <!--  awarding pecuniary prizes for the best contributors --> can stimulate risk taking and participation in less-easily contractible tasks, as discussed by @lazear1981rank; @green1983comparison; @mary1984economic among others. However, <!-- standard contest theory literature does not take into account the non-rival nature of contributing which constitutes the public good contribution problem. --> traditional organizational literature does not take into account the non-rival nature of contributing  which constitutes the public good problem. Standard contest theory models presumes that the contest outcomes will be enjoyed only by the sponsor of the competition (e.g., the manager, entrepreneur) with small gains for the competitors beyond the prizes given to the winners.^[One notable exception is the model of tournaments with positive externalities introduced by @drago1988incentive.] Though realistic in many situations, this assumption becomes questionable when competitors can expect gains from the work of others, as in the case of a competition aiming at  organizational improvements. The use of contests under these circumstances raises an important question: Will prizes be effective in fostering participation and contributions to internal public goods inside organizations? <!--  To what extent employees "spontaneously" (without explicit incentives) internalize the need of improvements? -->

In the present study, we report the results of a natural field experiment to compare two dominant perspectives on the issue. The first comes from the seminal work of @morgan2000financing, who stresses that awarding prizes in lottery-like contests will mitigate, or even eliminate, the incentive to free riding. At the margin, employees choose their effort levels so that expected gains and costs are equal. Because these gains include the direct utility from receiving personal rewards and from improving the organization, even small prizes will boost participation beyond what one would expect from the pecuniary value of the prize alone. The second perspective is that, when the task matches the preferences of workers in increasing organizational efficiency, workers will volunteer their effort and organizations can economize on the incentives, as discussed by @besley2005competition, @prendergast2007motivation, @delfgaauw2008incentives among others.^[Everyday evidence for this kind of "altruistic" behavior comes from blood donations, charitable giving, social workers. See also the results of laboratory experiments based on economic games [see @levitt2007laboratory] and field studies showing evidence on prosocial preferences at work [@bandiera2005social; @dellavigna2016estimating].] Furthermore, announcing a competition for prizes can also cause unintentional adverse consequences. It may evoke mixed feelings in workers with different competitive inclinations or risk aversion, a disposition potentially different for men and women [@niederle2007women; @croson2009gender]; it may inadvertently promote unethical behavior [@lazear1989pay; @charness2013dark]; weaken intrinsic motivations [@reeve1996elements; @frey1997not]; and even kill the creativity of innovative work [@erat2015incentives].

The study was conducted in collaboration with the Massachusetts General Hospital's (MGH) Corrigan Minehan Heart Center ("Heart Center"), a prominent medical organization in the United States and a teaching hospital of the Harvard Medical School. The health care delivery context is particularly relevant for studying public-good provision problems as the need for organizational improvement and innovation is vastly noted [e.g., @cutler2012reducing]. Also, health care professionals are commonly seen as motivated workers willing to step beyond the boundaries of their contractual duties to offer better care [@delfgaauw2005dedicated], which makes the comparison of different incentives in a public good context particularly relevant.  


The context of the experiment was the launch of an internal four week "innovation contest" aimed at improving the operations of the organization, in the spirit of "open innovation" initiatives discussed in @terwiesch2008innovation, @guinan2013experiments, @lakhani2013prize, and @glaeser2016predictive. Employees were asked to submit project proposals addressing existing problems or providing improvements. The MGH executives committed to giving top proposals proper resources for implementation. Staff members could expect more costs and responsibilities from making a winning proposal, such as providing further guidance or a direct involvement in special implementation teams. These other costs were not well matched by any direct compensation from winning the competition. Employees having made the top submissions were awarded in-kind prizes (Apple iPad mini's), the value of which was relatively small in comparison to the foreseeable costs of unpaid project implementation time.  <!-- 
clear opportunity for the winners to increase the chances of a promotion  or tenure, which are based on wholly different criteria. -->

The subject pool was the entire population of over 1,200 staff members of the Heart Center including physicians, nurses, and administrative workers. Our main intervention was in altering the content of personalized solicitations to participate in the innovation contest among randomly selected staff members. By doing so, we were able to get causal estimates of the effect of different incentives on two main outcomes: (a) the decision to submit and engage in implementation activities of a project proposal and (b) the quality of the proposal submitted, as measured by over 12,000 ratings made by peers. Using data on profession and gender, we could also characterize the heterogeneity of responses to the treatment, testing the implications of our intervention for the organization.

We designed four treatments related to our research questions. In a first treatment (PRIZE), the solicitation nudged employees to participate in the initiative by announcing a personal reward (an Apple iPad mini) for the top submissions. In a second treatment (FUND), the solicitation nudged employees with the funding opportunity alone and an explicit commitment by Hearth Center executives to pay expenses up to $20,000 towards implementation of the proposal (the submitters would not receive this money for personal use). In the remaining two treatments, we "framed" the contest by emphasizing the opportunity to improve the healthcare of the patients (PCARE) or the workplace (WPLACE).

<!-- 
Also, the innovation contest marked the first time for the Heart Center and MGH. So, staff members had no prior experience and learned the opportunity primarily via our individualized communication strategy. Staff members were further asked to make individual submissions, thus helping us to exclude other common mechanisms to raise individual levels of effort, such as peer pressure, peer monitoring, or being part of a team [e.g., @kandel1992peer; @hamilton2003team].

<!-- Results -->
```{r}
submitters  <- hc$num_ideas>0
participants <- ifelse(hc$num_ideas>0 | hc$num_voted_ideas >0, 1, 0)
```

We find that workers were eager to contribute to improving the organization despite its cost: `r sum(participants)` employees (`r round(100*mean(participants))` percent) across the entire organization took part in the initiative, with `r round(100*mean(submitters))` percent of our sample submitting project proposals.^[By comparison, in a purely public good setting such as @list2002effects's field experiment on individual monetary contributions to charity, the authors find very similar participation rates between 3 and 8 percent. Similarly, in a setting that involves employees of a consulting company making proposals to clients with no clear public good incentive, @gibbs2014field finds participation rates that are slightly higher (about 10 percent) but over a two-year period versus our four-week competition.] About half of these participating employees were invited by Heart Center executives to follow up with detailed implementation plans, which culminated in two proposals receiving full funding.

Our main finding is that small prizes boosted participation without lowering the quality of the submissions. In fact, simply announcing a personal reward (PRIZE) produced a 2.5 percentage points (85 percent) increase in participation rates than the average. This effect appears too large to fit a pure contest environment without public good incentives. The relatively high incomes of our subject pool, the low chance of winning, and the additional costs of being selected for implementation suggest that very few would find it advantageous to participate. We discuss several possible explanations for this observation. We conclude that awarding a prize increased participation by helping  employees internalize the effects of their active participation for improving the organization, as in @morgan2000financing. We then use a simple model to estimate the employees' underlying preferences for the public good, showing that these preferences can account for 25 percent of individual costs of submitting. 

Analysis of the ratings received by the proposals indicates there was no crowding-out effect, as the higher propensity of workers in the prize treatment does not seem to be driven by low-quality submissions. This result is robust to using ratings from the contest organizers instead of those from peers. We also find little evidence of a difference in content other than peer-evaluated quality, such as the count of projects proposals per proponent, the areas of focus, and the proposal length. Overall, these findings suggest no negative trade-off between quantity and quality: treatments that attracted more participants resulted in proposals of comparable quality and content. This also implies that monetary incentives were not counter-productive to creativity compared to voluntary contributions.

We did, however, find that a framing around the mission of the organization resulted in  responses that were sensitive to the gender of the solicited person. Women's participation was greater when emphasizing the patient care mission (PCARE) whereas men's participation was significantly lower, controlling for the profession. At the same time, we do not find gender-based differences with respect to participation in the prize (PRIZE) treatment: women's participation was slightly higher (but not significant) than men's. The first finding suggests that female workers may perceive the mission of the organization differently than male workers. Alternatively, women workers were simply more responsive to a call for helping patients probably due to gender-based self-stereotyping. The second evidence indicates relatively small and inconsequential gender difference in preferences such as competitive inclinations or risk aversion between men and women.

Finally, announcing a funding opportunity alone (FUND) -- even with a commitment of $20,000 in project funding -- made employees less likely to submit compared to all other treatments and no difference in the quality of submissions. This evidence confirms that to being in charge of the (winning) project was not perceived as a prize in itself. Hence, soliciting participation in this task without a proper announcement of personal rewards for the winners or the right framing might have exacerbated the incentives to free-riding.

Literature
==========

The present study contributes to the literature on the use of prizes (relative incentives) in the workplace [@lazear1981rank; @green1983comparison; @mary1984economic, among others]. Our main contribution consists in studying the role of prizes in fostering workers' participation in the field and in activities that produce organizational improvements. In particular, the observed increase in participation in the PRIZE treatment is consistent with the results of existing empirical studies [@bull1987tournaments; @knoeber1994testing; @eriksson1999executive; @ehrenberg1990tournaments; @terwiesch2008innovation; @terwiesch2009innovation; @boudreau2011incentives; @boudreau2016performance]. However, while most studies focus on tournaments that result in benefits enjoyed exclusively by the sponsor of the competition (increasing sales, production, revenues), we show that this positive result generalizes to situations that generate positive externalities for the contestants (innovation projects to improve the organization). Despite being a common situation,^[Members of the same organization often end up competing on the basis of their ability to solve common issues at the organizational level, such as addressing specific problems, innovating, providing business ideas.] this setting has received relatively less attention in past studies. 

Our work also contributes to the empirical literature on the use of contest-type lotteries to finance public goods that was first studied by @morgan2000financing. A number of works have shown a positive effect of prizes on the extent of individual contributions to a public good in the laboratory [@morgan2000funding; @dale2004charitable; @lange2007using] and in the field [@landry2006toward]. However, as noted by @vesterlund2012voluntary, the existing evidence on the profitability of contest-type mechanisms for raising money for public goods (e.g., charity donations) is only mixed [@vesterlund2012voluntary]. Our work provides further evidence to this theory as we generalize the results of past studies to an organizational setting. Within this setting, individual contributions are non-monetary but consist of time and effort in putting forward (and implementing) a proposal.  Whereas the public good consists of the potential improvements for the organization. Under such circumstances, we find evidence indicating that prizes can be very effective tools for raising the level of participation (compared to voluntary mechanisms) and appear overall a profitable solution for organizations.

Our results also relate to the literature on social preferences at work. A number of studies have shown that people tend to contribute to public goods despite strong incentives to free ride. According to the World Health Organization, about 60 percent of blood donations collected globally each year is from voluntary unpaid blood donors. According to @list2011market, charitable gifts of money are worth 2 percent of gross domestic product for the United States. @lacetera2014rewarding stresses that: "27% of Americans volunteer with formal organizations, for a total of about 8 billion hours per year." A sizable scientific evidence on this topic comes from a series of studies based on economic games in the laboratory [see @levitt2007laboratory for a review] and in the field [@bandiera2005social; @dellavigna2016estimating]. @bandiera2005social, for instance, shows that workers internalize preferences of co-workers and may reduce effort under relative incentives. Likewise, @dellavigna2016estimating shows a positive effect of mission-oriented preferences, also called "vertical social preferences,"^[Social preferences towards peers are instead called "horizontal."] on the level of effort of freelance workers folding envelopes for a charity. Our work is consistent with a positive effect of vertical social preferences; adding evidence that such social preferences not only increase effort in mandatory pre-specified tasks but also affect voluntary participation to non-mandatory ones.^[In @dellavigna2016estimating, workers can choose how much effort to exert but cannot choose which task to work on (in this sense the task is "mandatory").]

Another important aspect of the present study is that we focus on incentives to carry out a complex task (writing a project proposal) as opposed to standardized production tasks [@knoeber1994testing] or sport [@ehrenberg1990tournaments]. We also focus on a competition  among individual workers instead of teams [e.g., @erev1993constructive, @hamilton2003team and more recently @gibbs2014field]. This allows us to remove from consideration important team dynamics such as peer pressure, monitoring, reciprocity within the team that may also affect the participation and effort quality of employees.  <!-- In this attempt, @gibbs2014field is perhaps the study most closely related to ours. In an ideation task within a consulting firm, @gibbs2014field finds higher participation rates and quality with standard incentives tied to performance compared to flat wages. In that setting, however, employees are not competing for prizes and managers seek ideas that would "directly benefit the client, as compared to ideas that improve internal processes." Hence, an employee's idea is successful only when it is adopted by the client and has no direct impact on the organization. Our study is complementary to @gibbs2014field as we consider a competition (instead of standard pay-for-performance incentives) directed at improving the organization and its "internal processes." So, workers have an incentive to free ride not present in @gibbs2014field.^[Also, @gibbs2014field studies teams instead of individual workers. This implies that also in @gibbs2014field there may be a problem of free-riding within teams. Yet, formal teams are believed to solve internally the free-riding problem through peer pressure, monitoring, reciprocity within the team, etc. @hamilton2003team finds poor empirical evidence of free-riding in teams. In this sense, by focusing on individual workers, our results center on the problem of free-riding isolated from team dynamics.]  Overall, personal rewards have a positive effect on the participation but we find no (negative) quality effects. We argue this could result from the competition stopping workers from submitting innovation projects below a certain level of quality. -->

Finally, our work provides support to the incentive effect of a personal satisfaction derived from helping the organization achieving its goals [@akerlof2005identity; @besley2005competition; @delfgaauw2005dedicated; @delfgaauw2008incentives;  @prendergast2007motivation]. This type of altruism is believed to be an important driver of effort for workers in organizations for social public goods, such as hospitals, universities, schools, administrations, and the military. Theoretical models suggest different ways in which managers can exploit these prosocial motivations to raise individual productivity;  in the current study, we use "framing" to make particular motivations salient. We find that emphasizing prosocial motivations has countervailing effects on participation; negative for men and positive for women.^[Concerning framing, many studies have  explored the effects of positive or negative framing on the private provision of public goods in the laboratory [@andreoni1995warm]. Inside organizations, @hossain2012behavioralist and @hong2015framing are among the first studies to measure the impact of framing interventions on productivity. The current study adds to this literature by showing significant effects associated with a particular type of framing such as appealing to internal motivations towards the mission of the organization.] While this finding is consistent with altruism being one important driver of effort inside organizations, it also suggests that people are sensitive to framing and in ways that may be difficult to predict ex-ante.

Analytical framework and predictions
===================================

In this section, we conceptualize an internal solicitation for innovation project proposals to improve the operations of the organization as a voluntary contribution mechanism for a public good. Successful proposals are viewed as non-excludable because innovation leads to improvements for everyone in the workplace (including customers by increasing the quality and efficiency of the services provided). Submitting a proposal requires costly effort by employees, such as the time to identify a problem, form a proposal, write up a concise description, and the potential for further involvement during  proposal implementation.

Consider a linear model of the utility of a typical employee who contributes $x$ and benefits from total contributions of $Y=\sum x$:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:utility}
  u(R,~ Y) =  \gamma Y + \delta x + \frac{x}{Y} R - c x.
\end{equation}

The benefits of contributing derive from three sources. First, there is an altruistic benefit from the improved workplace, $\gamma Y$. The altruistic benefits are the crux of public goods. Only the existence of an improved workplace is desired and the source of contributions is irrelevant. Thus, everyone would prefer to free-ride on others' efforts. Second, participants have some chance of winning the contest and can expect to derive benefits from the prizes, $\frac{x}{Y} R$, where, for simplicity, all efforts have an equal chance of being selected as the winner, as in @morgan2000financing. The personal reward $R$ can be thought of as a pecuniary prize, but it could also be an increase in prestige or recognition or any combination of the above.  Finally, employees may have an egoistic motivation for contributing "per se," regardless of winning and the effect on others, which is captured by $\delta x$. This includes also the case in which workers may derive a personal satisfaction from contributing personally to the organization, often called warm glow preferences for giving [@andreoni1995warm]. Since we cannot observe the distinction between altruistic and warm-glow motives in our empirical setup, we are going to impose later that these preferences are such that $\delta=0$. 
 
Contributors incur some effort cost from developing and submitting a proposal, $c x$.  If there are $n$ employees the public goods dilemma arises when $\gamma+\delta < c < n\gamma+\delta$. Then no individual would contribute without a reward as costs exceed individual benefits, but everyone would be better off if everyone contributes. 

Suppose contributing a proposal is a discrete choice by employees. An employee can either contribute a single proposal $x=1$ and receive utility of 

\begin{equation}
  u_1 = \gamma \hat Y + \delta + \sum_{k=1}^{n}\Pr(Y=k)\frac{R}{k}  - c, 
\end{equation}

where $\hat Y$ denotes the expected level of contributions and $\Pr(Y=k)$ is the probability of having $k$ total contributions. Or they can contribute nothing $x=0$ and receive utility of 

\begin{equation}
  u_0 = \gamma (\hat Y - 1).
\end{equation}

If there are $n$ employees, then the unique symmetric mixed-strategy equilibrium is for each employee to contribute a proposal with probability $p>0$.  After using the binomial probability for $\Pr(Y=k)$, the payoff-equating condition to find a mixed-strategy equilibrium is:

\begin{equation} \label{eq: mixed-strategy}
  \frac{1- (1-p)^{n}}{n p} = (c- \gamma - \delta) / R.
\end{equation}

This equation admits one single solution $p^*$ which cannot be expressed explicitly. Using a first order Taylor expansion around $p$,  the equilibrium probability can be approximated as follows:

\begin{equation} \label{eq: probability}
  p^*  \approx \frac{2 (R- c+\gamma +\delta )}{(n-1) R}. 
\end{equation}

The analysis of the above model is used to derive the following predictions. 

1) The probability of contributing a proposal to improving the organization is zero when the prize for winning is sufficiently small relative to the individual cost of effort minus the preference for the public good (i.e., $R< c-\gamma +\delta$).

2) The probability of contributing a proposal to improve the organization increases with the value of the prize for winning.

3) The probability of contributing a proposal to improve the organization increases with the extent of individual preference for the public good ($\gamma+\delta$). 

Now suppose that the public good $Y$ constitutes the sum of innovation projects to improve the organization. Imagine that the quality of each project is randomly drawn from a discrete distribution, the same for every contributor (every employee who contributes is assumed to be equally likely to come up with a useful idea). Each proposal can be of high quality with probability $\nu$ and of low quality with probability $1-\nu$. If a proposal is of low quality, then the value for the organization is normalized to zero. The quality of proposals is learned only after the agent paid the cost of effort. Now the equilibrium public good $Y$ is not deterministic but follows a binomial distribution with average $E[Y] = p^{**} \nu n$, where the equilibrium probability $p^{**}$ can be derived as before with the only difference being that it is also an increasing function of the probability $\nu$. This leads to the following prediction. 

4) If the public good depends on the quality of each contribution and every agent is equally likely to make a proposal of high quality, then the higher the probability of contributing, the higher is the average public good.

This framework can be extended to the case of individuals with heterogeneous costs.  In the appendix, we explicitly consider the case of two types of individuals with different marginal costs of effort that form two groups of equal size. The symmetric mixed-strategy equilibrium is then characterized by the vector of probabilities of contributing with a proposal  $(p_1^\star, p_2^\star)$.  Here, the analysis of the payoff-equating conditions for the mixed-strategy equilibrium shows that the higher the marginal cost of effort minus preference for contributing, the lower the equilibrium probability of individuals (i.e., $p_1^\star > p_2^\star$ when $c_1 < c_2$, and vice versa).  This leads the final prediction. 

5) If individuals have heterogeneous costs, then the probability of contributing a proposal to improve the organization is higher for agents with lower costs (positive sorting).

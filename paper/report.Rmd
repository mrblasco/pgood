title: "Incentives for Public Goods Inside Organizations: Field Experimental Evidence"

abstract: "We conduct a natural field experiment at a medical organization that sought contributions to organizational improvement from its 1200 employees. Offering a prize for best submissions boosted participation without affecting the quality of the submissions, as measured by peer ratings and the management. By contrast, offering financial resources to lead one's own project implementation had a negative effect on participation with no effects on quality. Mission-oriented solicitations towards improving the care of patients or the workplace were equally effective on average, but responses were sensitive to the solicited person's gender (with women responding more than men to mission-oriented incentives). Implications xxxx."

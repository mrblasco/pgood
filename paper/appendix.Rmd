# Extended model with heterogenous costs

Consider the case of two types of agents $j=1,2$ forming two groups of equal size $n_1=n_2=n$. Agents can decide to contribute with a single proposal or not.  When an agent of type $j$ decides to contribute, then the expected utility is:

\begin{equation}
  u_1^j = \gamma\hat Y + \delta_j + \sum_{k_j=1}^n \sum_{k_l=0}^n \Pr(Y=k_j+k_l) \frac{R}{k_j+k_l} - c_j.
\end{equation}

When an agent of type $j$ decides to not contribute, then the utility is:

\begin{equation}
 u_0^j = \gamma (\hat Y - 1).
\end{equation}

Equating these two conditions for all individuals gives the following mixed-strategy equilibrium condition:

\begin{equation}
\sum_{k_j=1}^n \sum_{k_l=0}^n \Pr(Y=k_j+k_l) \frac{R}{k_j+k_l} 
  = c_j -\delta_j + \gamma \quad\text{for all}\quad j=1,2.
\end{equation}

To examine differences in equilibrium probabilities $p_1^*$ and $p_2^*$, we use the ratio between the above equilibrium condition for individuals of type $j=1$ and the same expression for agents of type $j=2$. This gives: 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\sum_{k_1=1}^n \sum_{k_2=0}^n \Pr(Y=k_1+k_2) \frac{R}{k_1+k_2}}{\sum_{k_1=0}^n \sum_{k_2=1}^n \Pr(Y=k_1+k_2) \frac{R}{k_1+k_2}} = \frac{c_1 -\delta_1 + \gamma}{c_2 -\delta_2 + \gamma}.
\end{equation}
The left hand side can be rearranged as follows.
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Pr(k_2=0) \sum_{k_1=1}^n\Pr(Y=k_1)\frac{R}{k_1} +  \sigma R}{\Pr(k_1=0) \sum_{k_2=1}^n\Pr(Y=k_2)\frac{R}{k_2} +  \sigma R} 
\end{equation}
where $\sigma = \sum_{k_1=1}^n \sum_{k_2=1}^n \Pr(Y=k_1+k_2) \frac{1}{k_1+k_2}$.
Using $1-p_2=\Pr(k_2=0)$ and  $1-p_1=\Pr(k_1=0)$ together with the density of the binomial distribution, we obtain the following simpler expression.
\begin{equation}
\frac{(1-p_2) \frac{(1- (1-p_1)^n)}{n p_1} R +  \sigma R }{(1-p_1) \frac{(1- (1-p_2)^n)}{n p_2} R +  \sigma R}  .
\end{equation}
If $c_1 - \delta_1 > c_2 - \delta_2$, then the above expression in equilibrium needs to be larger than one. This inequality can be expressed as follows:
\begin{equation}
\frac{p_2 (1-p_2)}{(1- (1-p_2)^n)}  > \frac{p_1 (1-p_1)}{(1- (1-p_1)^n)}.
\end{equation}
Hence, the inequality is satisfied only if $p_2$ is greater than $p_1$. This proves the statement reported in the paper that if individuals have heterogeneous costs, then the probability of contributing a proposal to improve the organization is higher for agents with lower costs.

# Solicitation emails and website of the contest

We show copy of the solicitation sent via email (Figure \ref{app: solicitation}) and  the graphics automatically matching the treatment of the employee signing in to the contest's website (Figure \ref{app: graphics}). Finally, we report the text displayed in the "Rules of the Competition" section of the contest's website.

## Rules of the competition

- The Ether Dome Challenge is an ideas competition to
improve the Heart Center workplace, patient care, patient satisfaction,
workplace efficiency and cost.

- If you've noticed something about patient experience, employee satisfaction, workplace efficiency, or anything that could be improved; if you've had an inspiration about a new way to safeguard health; or if you simply have a cost-saving idea, then now is the time to share your idea. We would like to encourage all members of
the Heart Center to participate in this initiative. We encourage you to
submit as many ideas as you have: no ideas are too big or too small! You
never know... your idea could be the next big thing!

*Timeline*

-  Ideation Contest Launch
-  Idea Submission Closes
-  Crowd-Voting on Submitted Ideas
-  Top 3 Crowd Voting Winners Announced (winners will receive
iPads) & Final Round Idea Selections Announced
-  Final Round Idea "Brainstorming" Support Sessions & Team

*Logistics of Idea Submissions*

- All Heart Center Staff (physicians, nurses, administrators, etc.) are eligible to submit Ideas.
- Ideas should be submitted electronically via this site. Please click the "Submit Your Ideas" button at the top of the page, to enter the Challenge.
- Submit as many ideas as you'd like!

*To promote all kinds of ideas... even the zanny ones!*

- All ideas submitted during the challenge will be posted on this website to be voted on by all Heart Center staff. The best ideas will be awarded a prize. To keep voting fair, ideas will be anonymously posted to the voting site. If your idea wins, you will be able to choose whether or not you'd like recognition for the idea. To ensure everyone feels free to submit all types of creative ideas - no matter how disruptive - all ideas will remain anonymous and shared only with the Harvard Business School study designers and the MGH Healthcare Transformation Lab staff. Individual information/ideas will not be shared with your managers/division heads, unless you elect for it to be shared publicly after the voting period. De-identified idea submissions will be shared with all levels of hospital administration deemed appropriate by the Healthcare Transformation Lab staff.

*Areas of focus - but don't limit your thinking!*

- Areas of focus for the Ether Dome Challenge include, but are not limited to: New models of care delivery; Enhancing the patient experience; Improving the MGH workplace, Improving efficiency, quality and safety; Lowering the cost of care

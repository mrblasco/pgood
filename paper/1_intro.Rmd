# Introduction

Public good provision problems are pervasive in the workplace. Given workers are directly dependent on each other to progress in their job, they often face a dilemma when choosing between contributing to common resources which are valuable to them and the organization, or behaving opportunistically hoping that others will incur the cost of these  contributions.[^PROFESSORS] One key problem is that employees often  must go above and beyond their own assigned tasks to make these contributions, which are then ungoverned by formal evaluation and reward systems. This fact prompts an important question with many organizational implications: what motivates employees to self-select into unpaid tasks and volunteer work for the benefit of the organization?

An extensive literature in economics points to volunteering at work as a way to receive extrinsic benefits, such as career advancements or a positive reputation.[^CAREERS] But there is also a growing literature that links this kind of volunteering to a form of *altruism* that goes either from the worker to the other members of the organization [@bandiera2005social; @rotemberg2006altruism] or from the worker to people who might benefit from the activities of the organization [@delfgaauw2005dedicated; @delfgaauw2008incentives; @prendergast2007motivation]. This second view is usually predominant in organizations in which workers may feel a sense of duty that acts as a motivation [@akerlof2005identity; @besley2005competition], like those producing collective goods (e.g., hospitals, schools, government agencies). However, the lack of systematic empirical evidence on employee behavior makes difficult to assess the strength of these different motivations and predict in which direction these might affect the dilemma faced by workers inside organizations.[^LABORATORY]

[^CAREERS]: See @gibbons1999careers for a survey of the theoretical literature on careers in organizations.

[^LABORATORY]: An extensive literature has looked at settings that mimic the employee-employer relationship in the laboratory [see XXX for example].

In this study, one primary goal is to empirically examine how employees respond to a public good dilemma in a field setting where both kinds of motives are likely to be present. In particular, we examine how over 1,200 staff members (doctors, nurses, and administrative staff) of an elite medical organization in the United States respond to an organization-wide call to participate in an internal contest about suggestions of organizational improvement opportunities. The contest solicited employees to submit project proposals describing an existing problem and providing a solution to address the problem, in the spirit of "open innovation" discussed in @terwiesch2008innovation; @lakhani2013prize; and @glaeser2016predictive. The entire staff was then invited to read and rate each proposal on a five-point scale. Based on these ratings and other criteria, the winning proposal would receive funding for implementation, implying additional costs and responsibilities from making a winning proposal (e.g., providing further guidance or a direct involvement in implementation).

One reason to focus on employee behaviors associated with an internal contest, rather than some other kind of incentive scheme, is the practical consideration that such competitions are easy to run and common to most organizations.[^EXAMPLES] From another perspective, it is relatively inexpensive for the organization to alter the communications around the contest in a way to separately identify channels associated with the extrinsic and intrinsic motives of employees to participate. For example, the messaging strategy may convey information about the presence of personal awards for the winners, or not. Contests represent thus an ideal setting for experimental interventions to study in the field how employees self-select themselves into tasks that generate public good effects for the organization.

Another key element of our study is the focus on the health care delivery context, which is important for two main reasons. First, the need for organizational improvement and innovation is vastly noted [@cutler2012reducing]. Second, health care professionals are commonly seen as willing to step beyond the boundaries of their contractual duties to offer better care [@delfgaauw2005dedicated], which makes the comparison of different incentives towards a public good especially relevant and interesting.

Within this empirical context, we conduct a natural field experiment based on a randomized messaging strategy that  isolates and provides evidence on four possible incentives that underlie employee participation in the contest: (1) the presence of financial awards for the winners; (2) the opportunity of funding most valuable contributions; or simply put an emphasis on (3) the potential positive impact on the other workers or (4) on the patients (the customers).  In particular, we compare the responses of staff members who were exposed to four different *solicitation treatments.* These are email contest announcements seeking participation in the contest. All the four solicitation emails were identical except for the first paragraph which was assigned at random to isolate the above different motives.

<!-- : (1) the opportunity of winning an individual reward (PRIZE); (2) the opportunity of winning implementation money to lead one's own improvement project (FUND); (3) a generic call to improve the workplace (WPLACE) with no direct individual reward for the winners; and (4) a generic call to improve the care of patients (PCARE) with no direct individual reward for the winners.  (1) the opportunity of winning a personal award; (2) the opportunity of leading the implementation of their contributions; and (3) contests that offer small personal awards for the winners may increase participation because they generate two opposing externalities that can mitigate the free riding incentives: one is a negative externality that arises from the competition for a fixed-value prize; and the other is the positive externality of contributing to a public good; (2) contests that offer organizational resources that can be spent in the implementation of the contributions made by the winners may increase participation when the costs associated with the management of additional resources are lower than the utility derived by the worker from contributing to the organization for its own good; and (3) an internal contest is, beyond a competition, an event that serves to signal relevant organizational needs to the entire workforce, thus stimulating employee participation out of their intrinsic motivations towards improving the organization.
 -->

Within this empirical context, we obtain causal estimates of the effect of different solicitation strategies on two main outcomes: (a) employee participation measured by the decision to submit a proposal and engage in an organizational improvement task and (b) the quality of the submissions as measured by (over 12,000) peer ratings and by the management organizing the contest. 

Testing the presence of both participation and quality effects is important as the presence of systematic quality differences associated with different motivations would substantially complicate the problem of incentives for the organization. For example, a higher employee participation may represent a desirable outcome for the organization  but it may also be a waste of resources if the increased participation level is mainly driven by employees with low-quality proposals who would have stayed away from the contest otherwise. 

Another key issue is whether the solicited contributions will be representative of the needs of the entire organization, or just a smaller group of people. The presence of sorting effects based on the gender, for example, may impact on the extent and type of public goods provided, complicating the analysis of the incentives substantially.  So, another aim of our study is to test to see whether differences in the motives to participate are attributable to factors associated with the employee's profession, gender, and position inside the organization.

<!-- Results -->

The analysis reveals that our experimental intervention achieved overall significant effects on employee participation, with small and insignificant effects on the quality of the proposals. In particular, our findings suggest that: (1) the opportunity of winning a prize dominates all other incentives; (2) the opportunity of leading implementation of one's own submitted project proposal is the least effective incentive and seems to be perceived more as a cost than a reward; (3) the increase in participation rates associated with the announcement of a prize is without lowering the quality of submissions; and (4) calibration of a simple linear public-good model, reveals further that responses to the prize incentive may go beyond the extrinsic value of the prize, consistently with our theory of prizes as means to internalize public goods.

In addition, by looking at the sorting by gender, profession, and position inside the organization, we find that: (5) solicitation treatments with mission-oriented incentives alone may result in responses that appear sensitive to the gender of the solicited person (women's response to solicitations for improving patient care is higher than men's); and (6) gender differences in preferences, such as competitive inclinations or risk aversion, may not exert great influence on responses of workers to the competition-for-prizes incentive (women's and men's response to solicitations for prizes are the same). 

The implications of these results for the provision of public goods inside organizations are discussed in Section \ref{summary-and-conclusions}.

# Literature

This work adds to the empirical research on the role of prizes in the workplace. Existing studies, however, have focused on contests where xxx xxx and contest organizers xxxx. Much less attention has been given to contests where output benefits contestants and competitors are affecting one another other than via competition for prizes. There exists literature on prize-mechanisms for public goods, but these have not been studied inside organizations. Less studies have looked at the winning of grants. And framing? But not in terms of the public goods. There exists an extensive literature in economics on the use of contests as a source of incentives inside firms [xxxx]. Much of the existing theoretical literature, however, presumes that agents are motivated to compete on the basis of the utility derived by winning personal awards. Less attention has been devoted to situations in which a competitor’s performance generates public good effects for the other competitors, and the whole organization (a notable exception is XXX). By focusing on incentives to workers to do organizational tasks (tasks with public good effects for the organization), we improve the existing literature in this direction.

[^mission]:  According to @besley2005competition, "Workers are typically motivated agents, i.e., agents who pursue goals because they perceive intrinsic benefits of doing so. There are many examples -- doctors who are committed to saving lives, researchers to advancing knowledge, judges to promoting justice, and soldiers to defending their country in battle."

[^caveat]: As shown by @morgan2000financing, this property holds only when (i) the chances of winning are proportional to one's contribution to the public good and (ii) the value of the prize is fixed (independent of effort).


Economists have long recognized that prize-based competitions are an important  source of incentives inside organizations [@lazear1981rank; @green1983comparison; @nalebuff1983prizes; @mary1984economic]. Much of the existing theoretical literature in labor economics, however, presumes that agents are motivated to compete solely on the basis of the utility derived by winning one of the prizes. Less attention has been devoted to situations in which a competitor's performance generates public good effects for the other competitors, and the whole organization; a notable exception is XXX. By focusing on incentives to workers to do organizational tasks (tasks with public good effects for the organization), we improve the existing literature in this direction. 

 for which there exist consistent findings across many different empirical settings, including sport competitions [@ehrenberg1990tournaments], production competitions in firms [@knoeber1994testing; @terwiesch2008innovation], and more recently online competitions [@boudreau2011incentives; @boudreau2016performance]. 

To be sure, free riding incentives inside organizations have been widely studied in labor economics, especially in the context of team production [@erev1993constructive; @hamilton2003team; @boning2007opportunity;  @gibbs2014field]. However, our study differs from much of the existing literature  in that it focuses on an individual competition where the team component is missing. That is,  the public good dilemma comes from externalities towards anyone in the organization, not just a set of identified team members. It follows that one can remove from consideration conventional team dynamics such as peer pressure, monitoring, reciprocity among team members, and other kinds of social interactions that have been shown to affect behavior in the presence of free riding incentives.

Our study is also related the literature in public economics that studies prize-based mechanisms to foster the provision of public goods. @morgan2000funding appears to be the first to note that fixed-prize lotteries -- a special case also known as "Tullock" contest -- are widely used tools among non-profit fundraising firms, showing conditions under which these may increase the provision relative to voluntary contributions. This insight has spurred much attention in public economics with several studies testing this idea empirically [see @vesterlund2012voluntary for a survey]. However, as noted by Vesterlund, the existing evidence on the profitability of lotteries for charities is only mixed. Our work extends the existing literature on the topic by focusing on an organizational setting where monetary contributions are replaced by effort and the "greater good" is helping the organization achieve its goals. Within this context, we find evidence that fixed-prize contests are a profitable tool to foster public good effects inside firms. 


Finally, our work provides support to the incentive effect of mission-oriented preferences -- inner satisfaction from helping the organization achieve its goals -- [@akerlof2005identity; @besley2005competition; @delfgaauw2005dedicated; @delfgaauw2008incentives;  @prendergast2007motivation; @rotemberg2006altruism] and social preferences at work [@bandiera2005social; @bandiera2008social; @bandiera2013team; @dellavigna2016estimating]. According to this perspective,  workers are motivated agents. They do their work because they care about their co-workers, employers, and customers. Theoretical models suggest different ways in which managers can exploit these intrinsic motivations to raise individual levels of participation and productivity. Here, we use announcing an internal contest for organizational improvements to make these motivations salient. We find that emphasizing mission-oriented motivations has countervailing effects: positive for women and negative for men. While this finding is consistent with altruism being an important driver of effort inside organization, it also suggests that people are sensitive to the framing and in ways that may be difficult to predict ex-ante.

# Conceptual framework and predictions

In this section, we conceptualize an internal solicitation for innovation project proposals to improve the operations of the organization as a voluntary contribution mechanism for a public good. Successful proposals are viewed as non-excludable because innovation leads to improvements for everyone in the workplace (including customers by increasing the quality and efficiency of the services provided). Submitting a proposal requires costly effort by employees, such as the time to identify a problem, form a proposal, write up a concise description, and the potential for further involvement during  proposal implementation.

Consider the public good $Y$ constitutes the sum of innovation projects to improve the organization.[^SUMMATION] Imagine that the quality of each project is randomly drawn from a discrete distribution, the same for every contributor (every employee who contributes is assumed to be equally likely to come up with a useful idea). Each proposal can be of high quality with probability $\nu$ and of low quality with probability $1-\nu$. If a proposal is of low quality, then the value for the organization is normalized to zero. The quality of proposals is learned only after the agent paid the cost of effort. 

[^SUMMATION]: Instead of using a summation, we could have used different functional forms for the collective benefits (e.g., the max). However, the presence of free-riding incentives does not crucially depend on this specific assumption.

Let consider first the simplest case where the probability $\nu=1$ so any project is of high quality for sure. We assume a linear model of the utility of a typical employee who contributes $x$ and benefits from total contributions of $Y=\sum x$:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:utility}
  u(R,~ Y) =  \gamma Y + \delta x + \frac{x}{Y} R - c x.
\end{equation}

The benefits of contributing derive from three sources. First, there is an altruistic benefit from the improved workplace, $\gamma Y$. The altruistic benefits are the crux of public goods. Only the existence of an improved workplace is desired and the source of contributions is irrelevant. Thus, everyone would prefer to free ride on others' efforts. Second, participants have some chance of winning the contest and can expect to derive benefits from the prizes, $\frac{x}{Y} R$, where, for simplicity, all efforts have an equal chance of being selected as the winner, as in @morgan2000financing. The personal reward $R$ can be thought of as a pecuniary prize, but it could also be an increase in prestige or recognition or any combination of the above.  Finally, employees may have an egoistic motivation for contributing "per se," regardless of winning and the effect on others, which is captured by $\delta x$. This includes the case in which workers may derive a personal satisfaction from contributing personally to the organization, often called warm glow preferences for giving [@andreoni1995warm]. Since we cannot observe the distinction between altruistic and warm-glow motives in our empirical setup, we are going to impose later that these preferences are such that $\delta=0$. 
 
Contributors incur some cost from developing and submitting a proposal, $c x$.  If there are $n$ employees the public goods dilemma arises when $\gamma+\delta < c < n\gamma+\delta$. Then no individual would contribute without a reward as costs exceed individual benefits, but everyone would be better off if everyone contributes. 

Suppose contributing a proposal is a discrete choice by employees. An employee can either contribute a single proposal $x=1$ and receive utility of 

\begin{equation}
	u_1 = \gamma \hat Y + \delta + \sum_{k=1}^{n}\Pr(Y=k)\frac{R}{k}  - c, 
\end{equation}

where $\hat Y$ denotes the expected level of contributions and $\Pr(Y=k)$ is the probability of having $k$ total contributions. Or they can contribute nothing $x=0$ and receive utility of 

\begin{equation}
  u_0 = \gamma (\hat Y - 1).
\end{equation}

If there are $n$ employees, then the unique symmetric mixed-strategy equilibrium is for each employee to contribute a proposal with probability $p>0$.  After using the binomial probability for $\Pr(Y=k)$, the payoff-equating condition to find a mixed-strategy equilibrium is:

\begin{equation} \label{eq: mixed-strategy}
  \frac{1- (1-p)^{n}}{n p} = (c- \gamma - \delta) / R.
\end{equation}

This equation admits one single solution $p^*$ which cannot be expressed explicitly. Using a first order Taylor expansion around $p$,  the equilibrium probability can be approximated as follows:

\begin{equation} \label{eq: probability}
  p^*  \approx \frac{2 (R- c+\gamma +\delta )}{(n-1) R}. 
\end{equation}

The analysis of the above model is used to derive the following predictions. 

1) The probability of contributing a proposal to improving the organization is zero when the prize for winning is sufficiently small relative to the individual cost of effort minus the preference for the public good (i.e., $R< c-\gamma +\delta$).

2) The probability of contributing a proposal to improve the organization increases with the value of the prize for winning.

3) The probability of contributing a proposal to improve the organization increases with the extent of individual preference for the public good ($\gamma+\delta$). 

Now suppose that the probability $\nu$ is less than one. The equilibrium public good $Y$ is not deterministic but follows a binomial distribution with average $E[Y] = p^{**}\nu n$, where the equilibrium probability $p^{**}$ can be derived as before with the only difference being that it is also an increasing function of the probability $\nu$. This leads to the following prediction. 

4) If the public good depends on the quality of each contribution and every agent is equally likely to make a proposal of high quality, then the higher the probability of contributing, the higher is the average public good.

This framework can be extended to the case of individuals with heterogeneous costs.  In the appendix, we explicitly consider the case of two types of individuals with different marginal costs of effort that form two groups of equal size. The symmetric mixed-strategy equilibrium is then characterized by the vector of probabilities of contributing with a proposal  $(p_1^\star, p_2^\star)$.  Here, the analysis of the payoff-equating conditions for the mixed-strategy equilibrium shows that the higher the marginal cost of effort minus preference for contributing, the lower the equilibrium probability of individuals (i.e., $p_1^\star > p_2^\star$ when $c_1 < c_2$, and vice versa).  This leads the final prediction. 

5) If individuals have heterogeneous costs, then the probability of contributing a proposal to improve the organization is higher for agents with lower costs (positive sorting).

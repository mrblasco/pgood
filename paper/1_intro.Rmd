# Introduction

Workers employed by firms are often expected to make contributions that go beyond an effective and efficient execution of their own tasks, such as to put their knowledge to use via suggestions for improvement (Osterman 1994). Contributions of this type are important because generate positive externalities for the other members of the organization, but are  also difficult to measure objectively so that it is hard to fully compensate the worker for its contribution. This paper is concerned with understanding what motivates employees to "go the extra mile" at work by choosing to perform discretionary tasks for the benefit of the organization, instead of behaving opportunistically; and how to design work environments that foster this kind of contributions inside organizations.

An extensive literature in economics points to volunteering time and effort at work as a way to obtain extrinsic benefits, such as career advancements or a gain in reputation.[^CAREERS] But it is also possible to link this kind of behavior to a form of *altruism* that goes from the worker to the other members of the organization [@bandiera2005social; @rotemberg2006altruism] and from the worker to external people who might benefit from the activities of the organization (e.g., its customers) [@delfgaauw2005dedicated; @delfgaauw2008incentives; @prendergast2007motivation]. These altruistic feelings that acts as a motivation can be also inspired by the "mission" of the organization [@akerlof2005identity; @besley2005competition], like providing healthcare to patients in hospitals, education to students in schools, services to citizens in government agencies. However, the lack of systematic empirical evidence on employee behavior makes difficult to assess the strength of these different motivations, thus giving no prediction as to which direction the dilemma faced by workers inside organizations might be affected by them.[^LABORATORY]

[^CAREERS]: Since career advancements are uncertain and depend on a variety of conditions and not on productivity alone, the prospect of a promotion provide motivations to do extra-work [@kreps1997intrinsic]. @gibbons1999careers gives a survey of the theoretical literature on careers in organizations.

[^LABORATORY]: There is a large literature that has looked at these preferences in the laboratory in settings that mimic the employee-employer relationship [see XXX for example].

In this study, we conduct a natural field experiment to provide evidence on the effectiveness of personal rewards and mission-oriented incentives within an internal innovation contest at a medical organization. The internal innovation contest aimed to spur voluntary contributions (project proposals) to organizational improvement from its more than 1200 employees. The experiment tested incentives for contributing by manipulating the content of personalized emails soliciting staff participation, such as offering ($i$) awards for winning submissions, ($ii$) funding for implementation of own projects, and appealing to intrinsic motivations towards ($iii$) improving patient care (a mission-oriented incentive) or ($iv$) the workplace.

~~~one primary goal is to examine how employees respond to a public good dilemma in a field setting where both extrinsic and intrinsic motives are likely to be present. In particular, we examine empirically how over 1,200 staff members (doctors, nurses, and administrative staff) of an elite medical organization in the United States respond to an organization-wide call to submit proposals for improving the organization to an *internal innovation contest*. Such innovation contest solicited employees to submit project proposals describing an existing problem and providing a solution to address the problem, in the spirit of "open innovation" contests discussed in @terwiesch2008innovation; @lakhani2013prize; and @glaeser2016predictive. The entire staff was then invited to read and rate each proposal on a five-point scale. Based on these ratings and other criteria, the winning proposal would receive funding for implementation, implying additional costs and responsibilities from making a winning proposal (e.g., providing further guidance or a direct involvement in implementation).~~~

The focus on the health care delivery context is important for two main reasons. First, the need for organizational improvement and innovation is vastly noted [@cutler2012reducing]. Second, health care professionals are commonly seen as willing to step beyond the boundaries of their contractual duties to offer better care [@delfgaauw2005dedicated], which makes the comparison of different incentives towards a public good especially relevant and interesting.

The focus on employee behavior within an innovation contest follows both practical and theoretical considerations. From a practical standpoint, the widespread adoption of internet-based centralized information systems has made organization-wide contests easy to design and run so that they are increasingly common in most organizations.[^EXAMPLES] This makes relatively inexpensive for researchers to intervene by altering the communications around the contest in a way to separately identify channels associated with extrinsic and intrinsic reasons for participating. For example, a personalized messaging strategy may either convey information about the presence of personal awards for the winners, or omit that information. An internal contest offers thus a very convenient setting for experimental interventions to study how employees self-select themselves into new tasks without affecting the normal operations of the firm.

From a theoretical perspective, the analysis of employee voluntary contributions to a public good in a competitive setting is very interesting since much of the empirical work on voluntary contributions and on contests has been done separately. However, theoretical work in the context of public good games has shown that prizes generate two opposing externalities : xxx and xxx. These externalities can mitigate the free-riding problem, thus increasing contributions to the public goods. We extend this reasoning to inside the organizations and we use our experimental conditions to see whether prizes can be seen as a way to internalize xxxx. 

We evaluate the causal impact of the randomly assigned experimental conditions on two main response variables: (a) employee participation measured by the decision to submit a proposal and engage in an organizational improvement task and (b) the quality of the submissions as measured by (over 12,000) peer ratings and by assessments of the management. 

Testing the presence of both participation and quality effects is important as the presence of systematic quality differences associated with different motivations would substantially complicate the problem of incentives for the organization (a higher employee participation is a less desirable goal if it is driven by  low-quality proposals). We also investigate the presence of sorting effects based on the gender, profession, and position inside the organization of the solicited employee, and whether there are  heterogenous treatment effects associated with these characteristics. For example, following the literature on gender-based differences in preferences [@croson2004gender], the gender may impact the willingness to participate in a contest for prizes, complicating the analysis of the incentives. 

<!-- Results -->
We find that the opportunity of winning a prize dominates all other incentives, leading to a sizable and significant increase in the rate of employees submitting project proposals. We also provide evidence that such an increase in submission rates is without lowering the quality of submissions and may go beyond the extrinsic value of the prize, consistently with our theory of prizes as means to internalize public goods. 

We also find that, on the contrary, offering grant money for leading implementation of one's own submitted project proposal is the least effective incentive, leading to a lower employee participation to the innovation contest relative to all other solicitation treatments with no difference in quality. 

By looking at the sorting patterns by gender, profession, and position inside the organization, we find that mission-oriented incentives result in responses that appear sensitive to the gender of the solicited person. In particular,  women's response to solicitations for improving patient care is higher than men's. We also find that women's and men's response to solicitations for prizes are the same; thus suggesting that gender differences in preferences, such as competitive inclinations or risk aversion, may not exert great influence on responses of workers to the competition-for-prizes incentive.

Overall, our findings imply that employee participation is different under different solicitation treatments, but with small and insignificant effects on the quality of the proposals. This means that understanding what motivates workers to self-select into the task is important. Our results seem to suggest that workers better internalize the positive effect of their contributions and participate more only when they are awarded a prize, even if the value of the prize is small relative to the costs associated with winning the competition and being selected to carry out implementation work for their proposal.

# Literature

Our work adds to the literature that analysis the problem of free-riding inside organizations, e.g., Alchian and Demsetz (xxxx). Much of xxx, however, is focused on compensation schemes for team production, such as internal contests (e.g., Erev et al., 1993), incentives based on group performance (Holmstrom and Milgrom, 1990), specialized task structures (Itoh et al., 1991), and reputation and peer monitoring (Che and Yoo, 2001). But the focus in xxx is more on team incentives, where peer monitoring could solve. In our study, the mechanism of peer monitoring is prevented by the innovation contest xxxx. We add to these literature by focusing on xxx outside of teams. 

This work adds to the empirical research on the role of prizes in the workplace. Existing studies, however, have focused on contests where xxx xxx and contest organizers xxxx. Much less attention has been given to contests where output benefits contestants and competitors are affecting one another other than via competition for prizes. There exists literature on prize-mechanisms for public goods, but these have not been studied inside organizations. Less studies have looked at the winning of grants. And framing? But not in terms of the public goods. There exists an extensive literature in economics on the use of contests as a source of incentives inside firms [xxxx]. Much of the existing theoretical literature, however, presumes that agents are motivated to compete on the basis of the utility derived by winning personal awards. Less attention has been devoted to situations in which a competitor’s performance generates public good effects for the other competitors, and the whole organization (a notable exception is XXX). By focusing on incentives to workers to do organizational tasks (tasks with public good effects for the organization), we improve the existing literature in this direction.

[^mission]:  According to @besley2005competition, "Workers are typically motivated agents, i.e., agents who pursue goals because they perceive intrinsic benefits of doing so. There are many examples -- doctors who are committed to saving lives, researchers to advancing knowledge, judges to promoting justice, and soldiers to defending their country in battle."

[^caveat]: As shown by @morgan2000financing, this property holds only when (i) the chances of winning are proportional to one's contribution to the public good and (ii) the value of the prize is fixed (independent of effort).


Economists have long recognized that prize-based competitions are an important  source of incentives inside organizations [@lazear1981rank; @green1983comparison; @nalebuff1983prizes; @mary1984economic]. Much of the existing theoretical literature in labor economics, however, presumes that agents are motivated to compete solely on the basis of the utility derived by winning one of the prizes. Less attention has been devoted to situations in which a competitor's performance generates public good effects for the other competitors, and the whole organization; a notable exception is XXX. By focusing on incentives to workers to do organizational tasks (tasks with public good effects for the organization), we improve the existing literature in this direction. 

 for which there exist consistent findings across many different empirical settings, including sport competitions [@ehrenberg1990tournaments], production competitions in firms [@knoeber1994testing; @terwiesch2008innovation], and more recently online competitions [@boudreau2011incentives; @boudreau2016performance]. 

To be sure, free riding incentives inside organizations have been widely studied in labor economics, especially in the context of team production [@erev1993constructive; @hamilton2003team; @boning2007opportunity;  @gibbs2014field]. However, our study differs from much of the existing literature  in that it focuses on an individual competition where the team component is missing. That is,  the public good dilemma comes from externalities towards anyone in the organization, not just a set of identified team members. It follows that one can remove from consideration conventional team dynamics such as peer pressure, monitoring, reciprocity among team members, and other kinds of social interactions that have been shown to affect behavior in the presence of free riding incentives.

Our study is also related the literature in public economics that studies prize-based mechanisms to foster the provision of public goods. @morgan2000funding appears to be the first to note that fixed-prize lotteries -- a special case also known as "Tullock" contest -- are widely used tools among non-profit fund raising firms, showing conditions under which these may increase the provision relative to voluntary contributions. This insight has spurred much attention in public economics with several studies testing this idea empirically [see @vesterlund2012voluntary for a survey]. However, as noted by Vesterlund, the existing evidence on the profitability of lotteries for charities is only mixed. Our work extends the existing literature on the topic by focusing on an organizational setting where monetary contributions are replaced by effort and the "greater good" is helping the organization achieve its goals. Within this context, we find evidence that fixed-prize contests are a profitable tool to foster public good effects inside firms. 


Finally, our work provides support to the incentive effect of mission-oriented preferences -- inner satisfaction from helping the organization achieve its goals -- [@akerlof2005identity; @besley2005competition; @delfgaauw2005dedicated; @delfgaauw2008incentives;  @prendergast2007motivation; @rotemberg2006altruism] and social preferences at work [@bandiera2005social; @bandiera2008social; @bandiera2013team; @dellavigna2016estimating]. According to this perspective,  workers are motivated agents. They do their work because they care about their co-workers, employers, and customers. Theoretical models suggest different ways in which managers can exploit these intrinsic motivations to raise individual levels of participation and productivity. Here, we use announcing an internal contest for organizational improvements to make these motivations salient. We find that emphasizing mission-oriented motivations has countervailing effects: positive for women and negative for men. While this finding is consistent with altruism being an important driver of effort inside organization, it also suggests that people are sensitive to the framing and in ways that may be difficult to predict ex-ante.

# Conceptual framework and predictions

In this section, we conceptualize an internal solicitation for innovation project proposals to improve the operations of the organization as a voluntary contribution mechanism for a public good. Successful proposals are viewed as non-excludable because innovation leads to improvements for everyone in the workplace (including customers by increasing the quality and efficiency of the services provided). Submitting a proposal requires costly effort by employees, such as the time to identify a problem, form a proposal, write up a concise description, and the potential for further involvement during  proposal implementation.

Consider the public good $Y$ constitutes the sum of innovation projects to improve the organization.[^SUMMATION] Imagine that the quality of each project is randomly drawn from a discrete distribution, the same for every contributor (every employee who contributes is assumed to be equally likely to come up with a useful idea). Each proposal can be of high quality with probability $\nu$ and of low quality with probability $1-\nu$. If a proposal is of low quality, then the value for the organization is normalized to zero. The quality of proposals is learned only after the agent paid the cost of effort. 

[^SUMMATION]: Instead of using a summation, we could have used different functional forms for the collective benefits (e.g., the max). However, the presence of free-riding incentives does not crucially depend on this specific assumption.

Let consider first the simplest case where the probability $\nu=1$ so any project is of high quality for sure. We assume a linear model of the utility of a typical employee who contributes $x$ and benefits from total contributions of $Y=\sum x$:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:utility}
  u(R,~ Y) =  \gamma Y + \delta x + \frac{x}{Y} R - c x.
\end{equation}

The benefits of contributing derive from three sources. First, there is an altruistic benefit from the improved workplace, $\gamma Y$. The altruistic benefits are the crux of public goods. Only the existence of an improved workplace is desired and the source of contributions is irrelevant. Thus, everyone would prefer to free ride on others' efforts. Second, participants have some chance of winning the contest and can expect to derive benefits from the prizes, $\frac{x}{Y} R$, where, for simplicity, all efforts have an equal chance of being selected as the winner, as in @morgan2000financing. The personal reward $R$ can be thought of as a pecuniary prize, but it could also be an increase in prestige or recognition or any combination of the above.  Finally, employees may have an egotistic motivation for contributing "per se," regardless of winning and the effect on others, which is captured by $\delta x$. This includes the case in which workers may derive a personal satisfaction from contributing personally to the organization, often called warm glow preferences for giving [@andreoni1995warm]. Since we cannot observe the distinction between altruistic and warm-glow motives in our empirical setup, we are going to impose later that these preferences are such that $\delta=0$. 
 
Contributors incur some cost from developing and submitting a proposal, $c x$.  If there are $n$ employees the public goods dilemma arises when $\gamma+\delta < c < n\gamma+\delta$. Then no individual would contribute without a reward as costs exceed individual benefits, but everyone would be better off if everyone contributes. 

Suppose contributing a proposal is a discrete choice by employees. An employee can either contribute a single proposal $x=1$ and receive utility of 

\begin{equation}
	u_1 = \gamma \hat Y + \delta + \sum_{k=1}^{n}\Pr(Y=k)\frac{R}{k}  - c, 
\end{equation}

where $\hat Y$ denotes the expected level of contributions and $\Pr(Y=k)$ is the probability of having $k$ total contributions. Or they can contribute nothing $x=0$ and receive utility of 

\begin{equation}
  u_0 = \gamma (\hat Y - 1).
\end{equation}

If there are $n$ employees, then the unique symmetric mixed-strategy equilibrium is for each employee to contribute a proposal with probability $p>0$.  After using the binomial probability for $\Pr(Y=k)$, the payoff-equating condition to find a mixed-strategy equilibrium is:

\begin{equation} \label{eq: mixed-strategy}
  \frac{1- (1-p)^{n}}{n p} = (c- \gamma - \delta) / R.
\end{equation}

This equation admits one single solution $p^*$ which cannot be expressed explicitly. Using a first order Taylor expansion around $p$,  the equilibrium probability can be approximated as follows:

\begin{equation} \label{eq: probability}
  p^*  \approx \frac{2 (R- c+\gamma +\delta )}{(n-1) R}. 
\end{equation}

The analysis of the above model is used to derive the following predictions. 

1) The probability of contributing a proposal to improving the organization is zero when the prize for winning is sufficiently small relative to the individual cost of effort minus the preference for the public good (i.e., $R< c-\gamma +\delta$).

2) The probability of contributing a proposal to improve the organization increases with the value of the prize for winning.

3) The probability of contributing a proposal to improve the organization increases with the extent of individual preference for the public good ($\gamma+\delta$). 

Now suppose that the probability $\nu$ is less than one. The equilibrium public good $Y$ is not deterministic but follows a binomial distribution with average $E[Y] = p^{**}\nu n$, where the equilibrium probability $p^{**}$ can be derived as before with the only difference being that it is also an increasing function of the probability $\nu$. This leads to the following prediction. 

4) If the public good depends on the quality of each contribution and every agent is equally likely to make a proposal of high quality, then the higher the probability of contributing, the higher is the average public good.

This framework can be extended to the case of individuals with heterogeneous costs.  In the appendix, we explicitly consider the case of two types of individuals with different marginal costs of effort that form two groups of equal size. The symmetric mixed-strategy equilibrium is then characterized by the vector of probabilities of contributing with a proposal  $(p_1^\star, p_2^\star)$.  Here, the analysis of the payoff-equating conditions for the mixed-strategy equilibrium shows that the higher the marginal cost of effort minus preference for contributing, the lower the equilibrium probability of individuals (i.e., $p_1^\star > p_2^\star$ when $c_1 < c_2$, and vice versa).  This leads the final prediction. 

5) If individuals have heterogeneous costs, then the probability of contributing a proposal to improve the organization is higher for agents with lower costs (positive sorting).

[^PROFESSORS]: Professors, for example, are expected to teach and publish research (with pay and tenure tied to performance in those tasks) and also to serve on various internal committees that directly benefit the university and department operations, with indirect benefit to committee members. Similarly, in companies, employees are expected to work on production activities and also to contribute to common resources, collaborate in teams, provide feedback on strategy and direction of the firm, and drive innovation efforts.

This would also keep procedure area schedules moving and decrease delays for the next case. . Ep lab, cath lab, interventional radiology, endoscopy etc. could send their patients there. Also patients such as ours who require only a 4-6hour stay could be admitted to this area vs utilizing a  floor bed.

Each midication requires a log-in click at the main computer, then a trip to the head of the bed to scan the syringe, then a return to the main computer to input the dose. Many patients are on 5-8 meds requiring many trips! Very Inefficient.","Design a hand scanner that has input capability so that when the med is scanned, the handset will ask for the dose  and the input will happen at the point of scanning.
